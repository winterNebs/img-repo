# Image Repository
TODO:
- Add final images
- Buy images
- Show balances

## Next Steps
If instead of a demo, this was supposed to be a real project, here are the next steps I would take:
- Pull out functions from index.ts (if you are interested in what this would look like, ask me about ASC)
    - Routes would go in separate files
    - 
- Register Page
    - This would be pretty straight forward, just didn't implement it because it is not absolutely necessary for the demo. (again if you are interested, ask me ASC)
- Other account related features
    - Rate limiting (ask me about ASC)
    - Reset tokens/email recovery (ASC)
    - A way to upload images
- Use db session (ie connect-mongodb-session) instead of memory store
